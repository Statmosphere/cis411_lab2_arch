# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [ ] I have reviewed the [lecture / discsussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal
